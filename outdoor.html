                -Guava can be grown from seeds, but cuttings or grafted plants grow faster.<br>
                -If using seeds, soak them in water for a day before planting.<br>
                -For cuttings, plant a 6-8 inch branch in moist soil.<br>
                3. Sunlight & Temperature ☀️🌡️<br>
                -Guava needs 6-8 hours of full sunlight daily.<br>
                -Thrives in warm temperatures (20-35°C).<br>
                4. Watering Schedule 💧<br>
                -Water every 2-3 days, keeping the soil slightly moist.<br>
                -Reduce watering in winters to prevent root rot.<br>
                5. Fertilization & Maintenance ✂️<br>
                -Use organic compost or balanced fertilizer every 6-8 weeks.<br>
                -Prune the plant regularly to encourage fruiting and shape control.<br>
                6. Harvesting 🍈<br>
                -Guava fruits are ready to harvest in 2-4 years.<br>
                -Pick when they turn yellowish-green and have a fruity aroma.<br>
            <b>🌾 Nutritional Requirements</b><br>
            - Prefers well-draining, sandy or loamy soil with a pH of 5.5-7.5.<br>
            - Requires nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK 10-10-10) for balanced growth.<br>
            - Calcium and magnesium improve fruit quality and prevent nutrient deficiencies.<br>
            - Organic compost or manure enhances soil fertility and supports healthy root growth.<br>
            - Regular mulching helps retain moisture and prevents weed growth.<br>
            <br><b>🛡️ Preventive Measures</b><br>
            - Plant in a location with full sunlight (6-8 hours daily) for optimal fruit production.<br>
            - Water regularly, especially during dry periods, but avoid overwatering.<br>
            - Prune dead or weak branches to improve airflow and reduce the risk of fungal infections.<br>
            - Use organic pesticides or neem oil to control common pests like fruit flies, aphids, and mealybugs.<br>
            - Protect young fruits with netting to prevent damage from birds and insects.<br>
            - Apply fungicides if necessary to prevent diseases like anthracnose and powdery mildew.<br>
